    13.6.20
    Forked so that branch master has all Instagram references removed - so it builds on Netlify.
    Branch Instagram still has all Instagram functionality intact and working.

## Branch notes

Master contains a version that builds on Netlify, without trying to pull Instagram feed
Instagram contains original attempt as per https://github.com/zefman/gridsome-source-instagram in index.vue
Axios contains axios version as per #11 at https://github.com/zefman/gridsome-source-instagram/issues/11
